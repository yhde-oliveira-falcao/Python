## Create a Python environment.
mkdir fastapi_crud_app
cd fastapi_crud_app


## Install FastAPI and Uvicorn.
pip install fastapi uvicorn

If SwaggerUI is stuck:
run this command: tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq python.exe"
then this command": taskkill /PID   37672 /F
(replace the number (PID) with the number of your python task.

Step 1: create a simple Hello World return page
Run the server (uvicorn main:app --reload) --> this will reload the app any time we change and save it.

Step 2: Create a page that returns the message plus an input on the GET request (on the path parameter)

Step 3: Pydantic Time!!! Let's create a data model and access it
Firstly we need to import pydantic: from pydantic import BaseModel
For using the POST request we need to enter http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs URL so we use SWAGGER
Save the info in a temporary model (data library)

Step 4: Automatic redirect after a POST request, with the arguments of the recent successful POST
for this we need to import "pip install python-multipart" to handle form data (this will work for HTML pages too
We also need to handle the response (from HTTP (this is automatically handled by fastapi) and then redirect the response: from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse

Step 5: See all the users!

Step 6: Set up MySQL for database!
First Install dependencies then, Set up SQLAlchemy DB engine and session, then Define a SQLAlchemy model (User), then Create a database table, then Insert users into MySQL instead of in-memory
"pip install sqlalchemy pymysql"
Then we need to create a database.py file and a models.py file (to respectively set the database, and set the model for users).
We also need to set the session maker to manage the sql session (from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker)
--> To make life easier you can install MySQL directly from browser and install the SQL Workbench so you can check the data and make queries directly from there :)
Also, install cryptography: pip install cryptography
